# Notes on Virtual Networking Concepts 

### Whats is Virtual Networking

Virtual Networking, in the context of cloud computing, refers to ***logically isolated network, created using virtualization technology***   

The virtualization enables you to create a ***network infraestructure*** without the need for physical hardware.

Virtual networks are used to connect and manage resources on the cloud resources.

Above, some key characteristics and aspects fo virtual networks:

- ***Isolation*** - virtual network provide logical isolation, allowing a separete network environment, with the same physical infraestructure.


- ***Abstraction*** - Virtual networks abstract the physical infraestrucure, enabling flexibility and agility in network design and configuration

- ***Connectivity*** - Virtual networks enable the connectivy between different resources, services and instances.

- ***Segmentation*** - Virtual networks allow you to segment your network into ***subnets***, each serving a specific purpose. _For example, you can create a subnet for private resources, such as databases or application services and a public resource, such as a web server_. It also allow automated networking changes based on application demands.

- you can use security feature like firewalls, network access controls and encryption.

- Virtual networks often support dynamic configuration through ***software-defined-networking(SDN)***

Virtual networks are a fundamental building block for deploying and managing cloud resources. 

# Cloud Platforms and Virtual Networking

to provide this logically isolated network, the cloud providers offer the virtual networking services, allowing the users to create and manager their virtual networks. 

***AWS*** and ***GCP*** virtual networking service is called Virtual Private Cloud(VPC) and ***Azure*** service is called Azure Virtual Network.
