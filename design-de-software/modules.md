# Modules

"One of the most important techniques for managing software complexity is to design systems so that developers only need to face a small fraction of the overall complexity at any given time". 
- Chapter 4, pg 19. 

- modules can take many forms, such as classes, subsystems or services. 

- in an ideal world, modules should be isolated, without knowing each other. But in the real world, modules know about one another 

- The best modules aer those that provide powerful functionality, yet have simple interfaces. 

the idea is that we can provide abstractions throught interfaces, and abstractions should be good. 
 a good abstraction is that one who is balance, do not expose unnecessary information and do not abstract important aspects... To give an example, the author talks about a car, who have a perfect abstraction, we dont know how engine, the power and the gas work inside a vehicle, but we receive a interface good enough to use it.
